# Day 8 alternatives


Today I don't have time to dissect and study all interesting alternative approaches,
but I'll make a note of them.

## Notable solutions

- (*) particularly impressed by /u/AshleyYakeley's [solution](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rbj981/advent_of_code_2021_day_08/hnpbpv2/) who defined a segment "signature".

- (*) /u/gilgamec's [solution](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rbj981/advent_of_code_2021_day_08/hnqtk67/) is interesecting automatic deductions per
wire. "The solution runs essentially instantly, even in GHCi."  I must admit,
I don't have the time to fully dissect and understand it, even tough I'd really
like to. I feel like this is an example I could learn from a lot.

- /u/dualized on [old.reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rbj981/advent_of_code_2021_day_08/hnr8tgw/)

- Also /u/tobbeben's [approach(https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rbj981/advent_of_code_2021_day_08/hnp7ohl/) is interesting using
a "magic" function.
