# Advent of Code 2021 -- Haskell solutions by 'szabi'

## Running the solutions

The solutions were executed with GHC 9.0.2, so that's what you should get with [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

To run them, switch into the corresponding `day*` directory and run them `Main.hs`:

For the first two days, use

    cd day1
    runhaskell Main.hs

From the third day on, use

    cd day3
    cabal run

## Branches

The `original-attempts` branch contains my original solutions.
The `main` branch can contain updates to my solutions inspired by others I found later, and also translations of alternate solutions to compare and study.
