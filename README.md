# Advent of Code 2021 -- Haskell solutions by 'szabi'

## Running the solutions

The solutions were executed with GHC 8.8.4, so that's what you should get with [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

To run them, switch into the corresponding `day*` directory and run them `Main.hs`:

    cd day1
    runhaskell Main.hs

## Branches

The `main` branch contains my original solutions.
The `updates` branch contains updates to the solutions I found later, usually inspired by others' solutions which I like or prefer.
